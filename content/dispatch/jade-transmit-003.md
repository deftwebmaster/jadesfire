I used to sprint. Stack habits, chase streaks, fuel the high of progress. It worked — until it didn’t.

Momentum is a lie if it only moves you forward when the winds favor you. The real ones? We build mass. Direction. Pull. We become planets, not projectiles.

Now I don’t track streaks. I track orbit. What still revolves around my core? What’s falling away?

You don’t need hype when your purpose has weight.

Stay grounded.
