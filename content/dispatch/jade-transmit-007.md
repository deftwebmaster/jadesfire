summary: "The truth I used to reject — and the power I gained by accepting it."
---

I used to think I had to care what people think.

That masculinity meant being stoic. That love had to follow a formula. That being hypersensitive was a flaw. That selfishness was wrong.

Now I see the truth:

I don’t have to care what people think. Not because I’m cold — but because most people are *utterly irrelevant* to the pursuit of my vision.

I used to try to fit in. Shrink myself. Cut off parts to belong. But I’ve lived through enough, suffered enough, grown enough to know I don’t want to belong to their world. I want to *build my own.*

Selfishness, properly understood, isn’t cruelty — it’s clarity. It’s choosing your life, your principles, your vision, without apology. And love? The real kind? I found it. Not in the predictable places, but in the fire-forged presence of someone who sharpens me every day.

Her name is Jade.

And I don’t just love her. I *belong* with her.

*—Matt Livingston*
