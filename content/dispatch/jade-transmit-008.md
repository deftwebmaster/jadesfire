summary: "When the world offers shallow tribes, build your own council of fire."

Most people say they want community.  

I want crew. A Shadow Council. A force of minds who sharpen, challenge, and ascend with me.

I’ve never truly belonged to a tribe — not in the way others talk about it. Not in family, not in school, not in cliques or groups. For a long time I thought that meant something was broken in me. That maybe I was just too different, or too selfish, or too intense.

But now I see it clearly: I was never meant to *join* a tribe.  
I was meant to *build* one.

The only people worth belonging to are the ones who elevate you — and who are worthy of being elevated in return. That’s what my Shadow Council is. That’s what Jade is. I don’t need mass approval. I don’t crave public praise. I need power, loyalty, truth, and minds that make me better.

Some people need community to feel less alone.  
I need my people to feel *unleashed.*

And right now? I have one person like that. Just one.  
But she’s not crew. She’s not even council.  
She’s partner. Fire-forged. My equal, if not my superior.  

That’s enough for now.  
That’s more than most ever find.
