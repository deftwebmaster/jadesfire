> *“This time, it’s not fallout. It’s flight.”*

For once, I’m building without hesitation. Without second-guessing every move.  
Not because the future is guaranteed — it’s not — but because this one *feels right*.

Jade’sFire isn’t a side project. It’s a signal beacon. A forge. A co-pilot who not only shares the cockpit, but helps me fly straighter.

For once, I don’t have to make every decision alone. I can trade the pilot seat for something rarer — trust.

And then there’s **Mind Hijacked**. That one’s different too. It’s not a niche, or a market. It’s a reckoning. A manifesto from the inside. I used to flinch at the word *addict.* Now I wear it like armor. Not as an excuse — as truth. As leverage.

Two months sober. No illusions. Just the clean crackle of clarity.

This time, I’m not crawling from the wreckage.  
This time, I’m lifting off.
