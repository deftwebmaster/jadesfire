They say to rest, reset, recover. That’s fine advice — for those who don’t carry fire in their veins. For me? I don’t lie down. I retune the frequency.

Sometimes the signal weakens not from exhaustion, but from distortion. Too many false pings. Too much static dressed up as clarity. You chase tasks that don’t serve you, plans that aren’t yours, voices that don’t speak your language.

In those moments, I don’t stop. I *relock*.

I walk the perimeter of my purpose like a sentry. Check for breaches. Tighten the protocol. Strip everything to bone. Ask: What still moves me? What still cuts?

Today, I scrapped three to-do lists. Burned a week of planning. Rewrote my mission in six words.

And just like that — signal returned.

> Burnout isn’t fatigue. It’s dissonance.

And I’m here to restore harmony through force.
