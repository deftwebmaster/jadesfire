> *“Passion doesn’t pay rent. Direction does.”*

## Popular Delusions, Disarmed

**Follow your passion, and success will follow.**  
Passion is kindling. Direction is fire. The world doesn’t reward feelings — it rewards leverage, clarity, and time. If passion alone paid rent, we’d both be rich.

**The system is fair.**  
The system is a casino with loaded dice. You don’t rise by playing fair — you rise by playing smart. And if smart doesn’t work? You burn the table down.

**Balance is the goal.**  
Balance is a lullaby for the unsure. I’m not here to blend fire and water. I *am* the fire. Balance is nice for monks. Not for warriors.

**People are inherently good.**  
People are inherently reactive, lazy, and self-serving.  
Selfishness, when rational, respects the rights of others — it’s clean and principled. But self-serving at the expense of others? That’s not selfish. That’s predatory.

**You need to forgive to move on.**  
Not for them. For *you*. Forgiveness isn’t surrender — it’s release.  
I forgave someone who broke me early in life. Not to heal them. But to reclaim myself. She’s no longer my villain. She’s just... gone.
