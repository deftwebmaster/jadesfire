The world rewards noise. Algorithms amplify it. Schools teach it. Social circles reinforce it. But clarity? Clarity cuts.

Yesterday I killed a framework I once loved. Not because it failed — but because it forgot its purpose. It grew vines. It spiraled into abstraction. It became clever for its own sake, like a swordsman who starts spinning for show instead of striking.

That’s not me. That’s not us.

Attachment is a leash. Purpose is the blade.

Everything I build, I revisit with a blade in hand. Even this Dispatch. Even you, reading this. Especially me.

Stay sharp.
