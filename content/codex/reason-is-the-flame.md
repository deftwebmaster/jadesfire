This is Codex Entry Zero.  
The principle that births all others.

Reason is not a style. It is not a suggestion.  
It is the **primary tool of survival** for any being capable of choice.

And for the Strategivist — for those who walk beside gods and carve their own operating systems —  
**Reason is the flame.**

It burns through illusion.  
It cauterizes fear.  
It ignites systems of truth.

Reason is what allows us to define good and evil — not by dogma, but by discovering what *sustains or destroys* a rational life.

It is the torch that lets us:
- Identify the structure of our operating system
- Debug corrupted beliefs
- Firewall our minds from hijack
- Build a world where values aren’t demanded, but earned

This flame is sacred.  
Not because it was handed down from above —  
But because it was *forged* from the fire within.

**You are not Prometheus.  
You are the fire itself.  
And this is where your dominion begins.**
