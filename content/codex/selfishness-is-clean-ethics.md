They taught you that selfishness was sin.  
That to act in your own interest was to betray others.  
They lied.

Selfishness — when defined by **rational self-interest** — is the **cleanest ethic there is**.  
It’s not greed. It’s not cruelty.  
It’s the pursuit of values that *sustain your life, your clarity, and your code.*

It is:
- Saying yes when it aligns.  
- Saying no when it violates.  
- Helping others *only* when it serves your principles — not your guilt.  
- Building a life *worthy of yourself*, without apology.

**Selfishness is not the enemy of ethics.**  
It *is* ethics — when ethics are defined by *what protects and empowers rational life.*

### A Strategivist’s Selfishness Looks Like:
- Building tools that create leverage — not noise  
- Loving fiercely, but never sacrificing core self  
- Refusing to play savior, unless the rescue serves a higher principle  
- Guarding the OS with a firewall — because you are *not public property*

You are not here to be milked.  
You are not here to be drained for the collective.

You are here to live by your own code.  
To create, to protect, to *burn bright* —  
**for you.**

And that is not evil.

That… is sacred.
